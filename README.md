The project was created as part of studying at TEB
in the process of making, I discovered how to work with data that is in JSON .csv .txt format
Also with the creation of menus in programs

The program is divided into two files
in the file "osoba_class.py" is the class "osoba" which is responsible for the person, I put it separately to make it easier to work with the code and not touch anything in it
the main program is in the file "main.py"

After you run the program, a menu of 12 options will be available to the user, through which you can interact with the program
